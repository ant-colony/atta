#IOT DEMO

This sample is to be used with Node Red [http://nodered.org/](http://nodered.org/). You need to add CoAP support for Node Red [https://github.com/gatesense/node-red-contrib-coap](https://github.com/gatesense/node-red-contrib-coap).

##Run the demo

- start Node Red: type `node-red` in a terminal
- start MQTT Broker: type `./broker.sh` from this directory in a terminal (of course you've installed before all the dependencies with `npm install`)
- start Groovy script simulation: type `./iot.sh` from this directory in a terminal

##Play with Node Red

W.I.P.
